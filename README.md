# Virtual-Keyboard
The Gesture-Controlled Virtual Keyboard is a real-time system that lets users search Google, YouTube, and Instagram using only hand gestures. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it detects fingertip taps on a virtual keyboard and auto-executes queries, offering touchless, accessible, and intuitive interaction.
